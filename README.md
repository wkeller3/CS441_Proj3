In this app there is a car which can drive by holding the screen. The car is created by attaching two wheels to a rectangle. The wheels, body of the car, and the ground were all drawn by me (which is why they don't look amazing). I tried a long time to figure out how to get the wheels to turn to move the car, but could not get it to work. So, the car moves by applying a force to the body.

If I had more time I would've liked to implement more features, such as a scoring system for how far you go, as well as a way for the game to end. I would also like to make the track longer, and add more detail to the background.
